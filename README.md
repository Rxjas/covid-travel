### About

    Through the use of APIs, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and various other tools; we have created an application that helps those who wish to go outside and travel in a safe manner. This application allows you to choose a state, and then goes on to display current information about the Coronavirus in that state. Then it displays information of that state's parks. This all comes together to create an easy experience for users to plan educated and safe trips.

### FAQ
     Why are there repeating images for parks?
    - Some parks do not come with images showing the park itself, so we added a placeholder image.

    Does the application work on mobile devices?
    - Yes. By using UIkit, and developing the application with a focus on mobile devices it works on both mobile devices and browsers.
 
     Where can I find the tools used to make the application?
